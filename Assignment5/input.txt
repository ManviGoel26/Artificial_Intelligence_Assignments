I am studying in branch ssh. The next semester is monsoon. I have not done any courses yet. I would like to take courses from cse, bio, or any other branches. I like algorithms, Internet of things, programming, maths, linear algebra, privacy, psychology, theatre, writing, ethics and game theory. I also like entrepreneurship and environment.
